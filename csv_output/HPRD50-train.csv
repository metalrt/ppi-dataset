360,HPRD50.d39,False, PROTEIN1 is a nuclear protein with a characteristic distribution in large irregularly shaped nuclear speckles and co-localizes perfectly with the SR domain-containing PROTEIN2 ,HPRD50.d39.s1
361,HPRD50.d40,True,Transient expression of the full-length PROTEIN1 without RSRS in U1240MG glioblastoma cells resulted in repression of PROTEIN2 promoter activity,HPRD50.d40.s0
362,HPRD50.d40,True,These results suggest that the relative abundance of the two splice variants of PROTEIN1 in brain could be an important determinant for the expression of PROTEIN2 ,HPRD50.d40.s1
